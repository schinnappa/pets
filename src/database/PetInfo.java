#2: German Shepherd Dog
A true dog lover’s pet, the German Shepherd Dog is intelligent and hardworking. They are also known to be extremely versatile and courageous. No wonder they are so often trained to assist people with disabilities, the
police, the military, and other service organizations.

#3: Golden Retriever
A very athletic breed, the Golden Retriever is another family-friendly pet with a fantastic demeanor. Because they love to run and play, they’re a great fit for families with young children. Also skilled workers, Goldens
are popular hunting companions, guide dogs, and search-and-rescue dogs.

#4: Bulldog
One of the fastest-growing breeds in terms of popularity, Bulldogs are fun and loveable. They are very calm when compared with the previously mentioned breeds, and they make great companions. They don’t need a ton of
exercise—they actually prefer to stay home and relax most of the time.

#5: Beagle
Conveniently sized with short, low-maintenance coats, the Beagle is a peaceful and cheerful pet. Unlike Bulldogs, Beagles do require some exercise, so a fenced-in yard is an ideal setting for them. A hunting breed with
great curiosity, these hounds enjoy exploring and keeping their noses active.

#6: French Bulldog
French Bulldogs have mixed demeanors—sometimes they love to run and play, and sometimes they just want to lie around and be loved. They thrive from human contact and attention, so this isn’t a breed to be kept alone for
hours at a time.

#7: Yorkshire Terrier
“Yorkies” are the most popular small dog breed in America. They become extremely devoted to their owners, and their small stature makes them a great choice for people who live in condos or apartments. They can be a bit
feisty at times, but overall this brave and energetic breed is excellent for anyone wanting a small companion.

#8: Poodle
Poodles are known for making regular appearances in dog shows. Their elegant form never goes unnoticed, but their personalities are just as charming as their looks. They’re smart, easy to train, eager to please, and lots
of fun to be around.

#9: Rottweiler
Large and powerful, Rottweilers are sometimes misunderstood because of their stature. They are actually very intelligent, easily trained, and willing to work. Their broad chests and muscular bodies stand out, but
Rottweilers have even bigger hearts and make for devoted companions.

#10: Boxer
Boxers have endless energy and love to play. Although they can be headstrong at times, Boxers are extremely loyal to their owners. They are great with kids while also being alert and courageous.
